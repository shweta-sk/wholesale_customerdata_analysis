INTRODUCTION

The market for the sale of goods to a retailer is known as a wholesale market. A wholesaler receives huge quantities of goods and products from the manufacturing unit and it then sells them off to the retail stores. The consumers buy these products from the retail stores. The price at which the wholesaler buys the goods from the manufacturer is quite less as huge stocks are bought in one go. The price is much lesser than the case in which individual retail stores buy them from the manufacturer. 
Initially, wholesalers used to be closer to the markets to which they supplied, rather than the source through which they got the products. In todayâ€™s scenario with the emergence of the internet and e-procurement, most of the retailers have started locating near the manufacturers. There are several channels which are being used to send the products.

GOAL

The main goal of this project is to analyze the wholesale market in certain states of the US. It is very important to analyze the current trend in demand of the customers, in order to avoid heavy losses. The supply of products should be as per the demand of the market. Both of these should go hand in hand in order to obtain profits.
